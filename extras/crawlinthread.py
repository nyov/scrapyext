Run Scrapy crawler in a thread - works on Scrapy 0.8

When you run the Scrapy crawler from a program, the code blocks
until the Scrapy crawler is finished. This is due to how Twisted
(the underlying asynchronous network library) works.
This prevents using the Scrapy crawler from scripts or other code.

To circumvent this issue you can run the Scrapy crawler in a thread
with this code.

Keep in mind that this code is mainly for illustrative purposes and
far from production ready.

Also the code was only tested with Scrapy 0.8, and will probably
need some adjustments for newer versions (since the core API isn't
stable yet), but you get the idea.
